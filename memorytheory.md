### 1.What is memory management in system programming?
Memory management in system programming is the process of efficiently allocating, tracking, and freeing memory resources used by programs during their execution.
### 2.Define virtual memory.
Virtual memory is a memory management technique that gives an application the illusion of having a large, continuous block of memory,
### 3.Differentiate between physical memory and virtual memory.
Physical memory refers to the actual RAM hardware installed in a computer, which stores data and instructions for running programs. It has a limited size and is accessed via physical addresses.

Virtual memory, on the other hand, is an abstraction provided by the operating system that allows programs to use more memory than physically available by combining RAM with disk storage (swap space). It provides each process with its own virtual address space,
### 4.What is the role of an operating system in memory management?

The OS acts as a memory manager that allocates, protects, tracks, and optimizes memory usage to ensure smooth multitasking and system stability.
### 5.Explain the purpose of memory allocation.
| Purpose                     | Explanation                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide usable memory       | Assign memory to hold variables, data, code           |
| Optimize resource usage     | Allocate only what is needed, avoid wastage           |
| Enable dynamic memory usage | Allow programs to request/release memory dynamically  |
| Ensure memory safety        | Avoid overlap or corruption between processes or data |
| Support program flexibility | Handle variable-sized data during execution           |

6.Describe the significance of memory deallocation.
| Significance                | Explanation                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Prevents memory leaks       | Releases unused memory to avoid exhaustion      |
| Improves performance        | Enables reuse of memory, maintaining efficiency |
| Ensures stability           | Prevents crashes from invalid memory access     |
| Supports dynamic allocation | Allows flexible memory usage during execution   |
| Reduces fragmentation       | Helps maintain contiguous memory regions        |


### 7.Define fragmentation in memory management.
Fragmentation occurs when free memory is broken into small, non-contiguous blocks scattered throughout the memory, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous blocks of memory even if enough total free memory exists.

### 8.What are the types of fragmentation?
two types 
### 9.Explain internal fragmentation.
Occurs when allocated memory blocks are larger than needed, causing wasted space inside the allocated block.
### 10. Explain external fragmentation.
Free memory is divided into small scattered chunks outside allocated memory blocks, so large requests may fail despite sufficient total free memory.
### 11. How is fragmentation managed in memory allocation?
| Fragmentation Type     | Management Techniques                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| External Fragmentation | Compaction, paging, segmentation, smart allocation algorithms |
| Internal Fragmentation | Smaller allocation units, slab allocation                     |

### 12. Describe the concept of paging.
paging is a memory management technique that eliminates the problems of external fragmentation by dividing both the physical memory and the process’s virtual memory into fixed-size blocks called pages (virtual) and frames (physical).
### 13. Explain segmentation.
egmentation is a memory management scheme that divides a program’s memory into variable-sized logical units called segments, each representing a meaningful part of the program, such as:

    Code segment

    Data segment

    Stack segment

    Heap segment
### 14. What is the difference between paging and segmentation?
| Feature             | **Paging**                                                            | **Segmentation**                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory division** | Divides memory into fixed-size blocks called **pages** and **frames** | Divides memory into variable-sized blocks called **segments** |
| **Size**            | Pages and frames are **fixed-size**                                   | Segments are **variable-size**                                |
| **Purpose**         | Solves **external fragmentation**                                     | Reflects **logical structure** of a program                   |
| **Addressing**      | Uses **page number + offset**                                         | Uses **segment number + offset**                              |
| **Logical view**    | Memory is treated as a flat linear address space                      | Memory is organized logically (code, stack, heap)             |
| **Fragmentation**   | May have **internal fragmentation**                                   | May have **external fragmentation**                           |
| **Table used**      | **Page table** (maps pages to frames)                                 | **Segment table** (maps segments to memory)                   |
| **Protection**      | Less flexible (same permissions for all pages)                        | Can set different protections per segment                     |
| **Sharing**         | More complex                                                          | Easier (entire segments like code can be shared)              |
