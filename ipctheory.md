### What is meant by an IPC Mechanism? 

IPC (Inter-Process Communication) refers to methods used by processes (independent executing programs) to exchange data and signals with each other. Since each process has its own memory space, IPC provides a way for them to communicate and coordinate.



### Why we use IPC Mechanism? 


We use IPC mechanisms:

✅ To share data between processes.

✅ To coordinate actions of multiple processes.

✅ To support synchronization.

✅ For resource sharing (like shared memory).

✅ To allow client-server communication (e.g., databases, file systems).



### What are the types of IPC Mechanism's? 

| Type                   | Description                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Pipes**              | Unidirectional communication (parent-child)   |
| **Named Pipes (FIFO)** | Like pipes, but with a name in the filesystem |
| **Message Queues**     | Send and receive messages asynchronously      |
| **Shared Memory**      | Fastest IPC, direct memory sharing            |
| **Semaphores**         | Used for synchronization, not data transfer   |
| **Sockets**            | Communication over a network or locally       |
| **Signals**            | Simple notifications to a process             |



### What is meant by “unicast” and “multicast” IPC? 

Unicast IPC: Communication from one sender to one receiver.
Example: Pipe between a parent and child process.

Multicast IPC: Communication from one sender to multiple receivers.
Example: Broadcasting a message using sockets to multiple clients


### What is meant by PIPES?

A Pipe is a unidirectional communication channel between processes.
It allows one-way data flow:

One process writes into the pipe.

Another process reads from it.

Types:

Unnamed Pipe: For related processes (parent-child).

Named Pipe (FIFO): For unrelated processes.

 

### What is meant by Blocking Calls? 

A blocking call causes a process to wait (block) until an operation is completed.
➡️ The process is suspended until it gets the required resource or data.



### What are the types of Blocking Calls? 

Types of blocking behavior:

Read Blocking: Wait until data is available.

Write Blocking: Wait until buffer has space.

Accept Blocking: Wait for a connection (in sockets).

Wait/Join Blocking: Wait for another process/thread to complete.



### What are the different types of I/O Calls? 

Blocking I/O

Non-blocking I/O

Asynchronous I/O (AIO)

Synchronous I/O


### What are the I/O calls we are used in IPC Mechanisms? 

common I/O calls in IPC:

read() – read from pipe, FIFO, socket, etc.

write() – write to pipe, FIFO, socket, etc.

recv(), send() – for sockets.

msgrcv(), msgsnd() – for message queues.

shmat() – attach shared memory.

semop() – semaphore operations.


### What are the Blocking Calls used in IPC? 

IPC-related blocking calls include:
| IPC Type          | Blocking Calls                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Pipe/FIFO**     | `read()`, `write()`            |
| **Message Queue** | `msgrcv()`, `msgsnd()`         |
| **Socket**        | `recv()`, `send()`, `accept()` |
| **Shared Memory** | `semop()` (used for sync)      |



### What is meant by Named Pipes? 

Named Pipes (also called FIFOs) are a type of IPC mechanism that allows unrelated processes to communicate. Unlike unnamed pipes, named pipes have a name in the file system, so different processes can open and use them.


### Where is the FIFO Object created? 

A FIFO (named pipe) is created in the file system as a special file (usually in /tmp/ or current directory).
You can see it using ls -l, marked with a p in the permissions (prw-r--r--).


### What is the call used to create a FIFO Object? 

int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
pathname: path to the FIFO file.
mode: permission bits (e.g., 0666).


### What are the Blocking Calls used in Named Pipes?
 
In Named Pipes, these can block:

read() → blocks until data is available.

write() → blocks until a reader is available or pipe buffer has space.

open() → open("fifo", O_WRONLY) blocks until a reader opens the FIFO.


### Why read system calls acts as a blocking call?

 read() blocks because it waits for data.

If no data is available, the calling process sleeps until data arrives or the writer closes the pipe.
This avoids busy-waiting and saves CPU.


### Difference between the Named Pipes and Pipes? 

| Feature         | Named Pipe (FIFO)           | Unnamed Pipe               |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Name**        | Has a name in file system   | No name                    |
| **Scope**       | Between unrelated processes | Only parent-child/siblings |
| **Creation**    | `mkfifo()` or `mknod()`     | `pipe()` system call       |
| **Persistence** | Exists until deleted        | Exists only during process |
| **Access**      | File path based             | File descriptor based      |


### What is return value of read system call? 

Returns number of bytes read on success.

Returns 0 if end-of-file (e.g., writer closed the pipe).

Returns -1 on error.


## What is meant by message queue? 

A Message Queue is an IPC mechanism where processes can send and receive structured messages (not just byte streams).
Messages are stored in the kernel, allowing asynchronous communication between processes.


### Why we use message queues? 

To send structured data (not just bytes).

To support asynchronous and non-blocking communication.

To avoid message loss with buffering.

To support priority-based message delivery.


### What is difference between Named Pipe and Message Queue?

 | Feature         | Named Pipe           | Message Queue                   |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Data**        | Byte stream          | Message structure               |
| **Blocking**    | Read/write block     | Can be blocking or non-blocking |
| **Persistence** | Removed when deleted | Exists until explicitly deleted |
| **Access**      | Through file path    | Access via queue ID             |
| **Priority**    | No                   | Yes                             |


### What is the system call used to create the message queue? 

int msgget(key_t key, int msgflg);
key: IPC key
msgflg: permission + creation flags (e.g., IPC_CREAT | 0666)


### Where was the message queue created?

 Message queues are created in kernel space, not the file system.
They’re managed by the OS and identified using a queue ID returned by msgget().


### What is meant by Shared Memory? 

Shared Memory is an IPC mechanism where multiple processes map a common memory segment into their address space.
It allows fast and direct communication by reading/writing the same memory.


#### Why we use Shared Memory?

 It is the fastest IPC mechanism.

Allows large data transfers without copying.

Enables real-time communication.

Useful when speed is critical (e.g., multimedia, games).


### Difference between Shared Memory and Message Queues

| Feature             | Shared Memory             | Message Queue           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Speed**           | Very fast (direct access) | Slower (kernel-managed) |
| **Data Format**     | Raw memory (user-defined) | Message structures      |
| **Synchronization** | Requires semaphores/mutex | Handled by queue itself |
| **Data Size**       | Good for large data       | Good for small messages |
| **Complexity**      | More complex (needs sync) | Easier to use           |


#### What is use of stat command? 

The stat command in Linux is used to display detailed information about a file or directory.
Output includes:
       File size
       Permissions
       Inode number
       Last access, modification time
       File type (regular file, FIFO, etc.)

command : stat myfile.txt


### What is the use of semctl command? 

The semctl() system call is used to control System V semaphore sets.
It is used for:
       Setting/Getting semaphore values
        Removing semaphore set
        Changing permissions or ownership
commands: semctl(semid, 0, SETVAL, val);   // Set value
          semctl(semid, 0, IPC_RMID);      // Remove semaphore


### How do we destroy the shared memory object? 

Use shmctl() with IPC_RMID to destroy a shared memory segment:
             shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
This marks the shared memory for deletion.


#### What is meant by Semaphores

A semaphore is a synchronization object used to control access to a shared resource by multiple processes or threads.
It has an integer value:
        Decrement (P/wait) when acquiring.
        Increment (V/signal) when releasing.


### Why we use semaphores? 

To avoid race conditions.
To ensure mutual exclusion.
To synchronize access to shared resources (e.g., memory, files).


### What is meant by Synchronization? 

Synchronization is the coordination of concurrent processes or threads to ensure correct execution (e.g., one process writes, another reads).
Used to:
      Ensure data consistency
       Avoid race conditions
       Maintain execution order


#### What is meant by Asynchronization? 

Asynchronization means that processes or threads run independently, without waiting for each other.
Pros:
      Better performance
       Parallelism
But can cause:
        Race conditions
        Inconsistent states


### Why we use mutex locks?
A mutex (mutual exclusion lock) is used to protect critical sections so only one thread or process can access the resource at a time.
 

### What is the difference between mutex locks and semaphores?

 | Feature     | Mutex Lock                             | Semaphore                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Value Range | Binary (0 or 1)                        | Integer (0 or more)          |
| Ownership   | Has ownership (only locker can unlock) | No ownership                 |
| Usage       | Thread-level locking                   | Inter-process or thread sync |
| Type        | Lighter weight                         | More general purpose         |


#### What is meant by Race Condition? 

A race condition occurs when multiple processes or threads access shared data at the same time and outcome depends on timing.


### What is meant by Deadlock? 

A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for each other to release resources, and none can proceed.
Conditions for deadlock:
                      Mutual exclusion
                      Hold and wait
                      No preemption
                      Circular wait


### What is meant by Critical Section?

A critical section is a section of code that accesses shared resources (memory, file, etc.), and must not be executed by more than one thread/process at a time.


### What is the difference between system v and POSIX?


| Feature     | System V IPC                 | POSIX IPC                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| APIs        | `semget`, `msgget`, `shmget` | `sem_open`, `mq_open`, `shm_open` |
| Naming      | Integer keys (`ftok`)        | Named using strings               |
| Portability | Less portable                | More portable (POSIX-compliant)   |
| Flexibility | More legacy style            | Modern and easier to use          |



### Describe the steps involved in creating and using a named pipe (FIFO) for IPC

Create FIFO:
        mkfifo("myfifo", 0666);
Writer Process:
        int fd = open("myfifo", O_WRONLY);
         write(fd, "Hello", 5);

Reader Process:
            int fd = open("myfifo", O_RDONLY);
            read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
Close FIFO:
           close(fd);
Remove FIFO:
           rm myfifo

used between reacted processes:
Create pipe:
         int fd[2];
         pipe(fd);  // fd[0] = read end, fd[1] = write end
Fork process:
           pid_t pid = fork();
Child Process (Writer):
             close(fd[0]);             // Close read end
             write(fd[1], "Hi", 2);
             close(fd[1]);
Parent Process (Reader):
                close(fd[1]);             // Close write end
                read(fd[0], buffer, 100);
                close(fd[0]);



## Describe the steps involved in creating and using a pipe for IPC

A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel used between related processes (typically parent-child). It allows one-way data flow: one process writes, another reads.
Steps to Create and Use a Pipe for IPC
Step 1: Create the Pipe
            int fd[2];
            pipe(fd);
            fd[0] → read end of the pipe
            fd[1] → write end of the pipe
            Returns 0 on success; -1 on failure
Step 2: Fork a Child Process
            pid_t pid = fork();
This creates a child process.
After fork(), both parent and child can use the pipe.
Step 3: Use the Pipe for Communication
Parent Process (Reader):
                close(fd[1]); // Close unused write end
                read(fd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
                close(fd[0]);
Child Process (Writer):
                close(fd[0]); // Close unused read end
                 write(fd[1], "Hello", 5);
                 close(fd[1]);
Step 4: Wait and Exit
          Parent can wait for the child using wait(NULL);
          Both processes exit cleanly

  pipe(fd) ─────→ [ fd[0] Read | fd[1] Write ]

       Parent                          Child
    ------------                   ------------
   | close(fd[1]); |             | close(fd[0]); |
   | read(fd[0]);  |  ←───────   | write(fd[1]); |
   | close(fd[0]); |             | close(fd[1]); |
    ------------                   ------------
